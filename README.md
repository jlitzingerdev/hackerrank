Solutions for various problems on Hackerrank.
The license for the code is MIT (as shown) unless otherwise stated.

The license on the challenge PDFs included is whatever is specified or whatever
the author put on the challenge in the first place, I am not attempting to modify
their license in any way.

As the whole point of these little problems
is to exercise my brain, I tend to re-implement them but use common references
to learn the algorithm behind the solution.  Some examples:

Algorithm Design Manual, 2nd Ed
Intro to Algorithms (Corman et. al) 2nd
Concrete Mathematics
Art Of Computer Programming

That means that, while I wrote the code for this specific implementation,
the algorithm was probably inspired by or directly pseudo-coded somewhere else.

All credit for that work goes to the original authors, no ownership is claimed.

With respect to the challenges themselves, don't copy this crap, I mean you can,
but what the hell for?  Is it really _that_ big of a deal to not do it yourself?

If so, then still, I'm sure you can find a better repo to copy.
